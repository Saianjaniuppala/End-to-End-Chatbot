End-to-End Chatbot using Streamlit in Google Colab

Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an interactive chatbot using Streamlit and run it in Google Colab. The chatbot utilizes a machine learning model or rule-based logic to generate responses based on user inputs.

Features

Interactive chatbot interface using Streamlit

Hosted on Google Colab with a public URL via ngrok

Supports text-based conversations

Easily customizable for different chatbot applications

Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed in your Colab environment:

Python 3.x

Streamlit

pyngrok (for exposing the Streamlit app)

Any chatbot model (pre-trained model or rule-based logic)

Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies

!pip install streamlit pyngrok

2. Create a Python Script for the Chatbot

Create a new Python file (app.py) and add the following code:

import streamlit as st

def chatbot_response(user_input):
    responses = {"hello": "Hi there! How can I help you?",
                 "how are you": "I'm just a bot, but I'm doing great!",
                 "bye": "Goodbye! Have a great day!"}
    return responses.get(user_input.lower(), "I'm sorry, I don't understand that.")

st.title("Chatbot using Streamlit")
user_input = st.text_input("You:", "")
if user_input:
    response = chatbot_response(user_input)
    st.text_area("Bot:", value=response, height=100, max_chars=None, key=None)

3. Run Streamlit in Google Colab

Execute the following command in a Colab cell:

!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501

This will generate a public URL that you can use to access the chatbot.

Deployment

The chatbot can be further enhanced by integrating a machine learning model such as OpenAI's GPT models.

Can be deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
